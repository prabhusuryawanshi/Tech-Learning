# EXECUTION CONTEXT

## _Introduction_
When the JavaScript engine scans a script file, it makes an environment called the Execution Context.
 
### _Types of Execution Context_
`Global` : The global execution context is created when a JavaScript script first starts to run, and it represents the global scope in JavaScript. 
`Function` : A function execution context is created whenever a function is called, representing the function's local scope.
