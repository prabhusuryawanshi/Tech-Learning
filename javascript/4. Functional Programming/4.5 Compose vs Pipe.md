## COMPOSITION AND PIPE

## _Introduction_

# COMPOSE
The compose function is like a magical spell that takes a list of functions and returns a new function. This new function, when called, will pass its input through all the functions from right to left.

```
const compose = (...fns) => (x) =>
  fns.reduceRight((acc, fn) => fn(acc), x);

const add = (x) => x + 2;
const multiply = (x) => x * 3;

const addAndMultiply = compose(multiply, add);

console.log(addAndMultiply(2)); // (2 + 2) * 3 = 12
```

# PIPE
The pipe function, on the other hand, works in the opposite direction. It takes functions and applies them from left to right.

```
const pipe = (...fns) => (x) =>
  fns.reduce((acc, fn) => fn(acc), x);

const add = (x) => x + 2;
const multiply = (x) => x * 3;

const addAndMultiply = pipe(add, multiply);

console.log(addAndMultiply(2)); // (2 + 2) * 3 = 12
```
