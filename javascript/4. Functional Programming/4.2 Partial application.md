## PARTIAL PROGRAMMING

## _Introduction_
Partial application is a functional programming technique in which a function is preloaded with some of its arguments, producing a new function that takes the remaining arguments. This allows you to create more specific functions from more general ones.

In JavaScript, partial application is often used to break down a complex function into simpler ones, improving reusability and readability.

## How Partial Application Works
Given a function f(a, b, c), applying partial application to one of its arguments (say a) will return a new function that still expects the other arguments (b and c). 

## EXAMPLE
```
function multiply(a, b) {
    return a * b;
}

// Partially applying the first argument
const double = multiply.bind(null, 2); // 'a' is fixed to 2

console.log(double(5)); // Output: 10 (2 * 5)
```
