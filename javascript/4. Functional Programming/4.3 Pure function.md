## PURE function

## _Introduction_

A pure function is a function that, given the same input, will always return the same output and does not cause any observable side effects. This concept is crucial in functional programming because it allows developers to write more predictable and testable code.

## Benefits of Using Pure Functions in JavaScript:
- `Predictability`: Since pure functions do not depend on or modify the state of data outside their scope, they are much easier to reason about and debug.
- `Reusability`: Pure functions can be reused across different parts of an application without concern for external context.
- `Testability`: With no hidden state or side effects, pure functions are straightforward to test; inputs and outputs are all you need to consider.


## EXAMPLE
```
function rectangleArea(length, width) {
    return length * width;
}
```
